• Designed and implemented a convolutional autoencoder for anomaly detection in cell images using Keras and TensorFlow.
• Preprocessed images by resizing, thresholding, and normalizing, ensuring computational efficiency and reduced input dimensionality.
• Built an encoder-decoder architecture with a latent bottleneck layer to identify parasitized cells via reconstruction errors.
• Calculated reconstruction errors and latent-space densities using Kernel Density Estimation to classify anomalies.
• Evaluated the model’s performance, achieving effective separation between healthy and parasitized samples with a mean reconstruction error ratio of 3:1.
